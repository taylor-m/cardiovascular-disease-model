# Cardiovascular Disease Classification & Predictive Models
 machine learning model to predict and classify cardiovascular disease
## Overview
The cardiovascular disease model is a machine learning model that aims to classify and predict the probability of 
cardiovascular disease in a patient given physical characteristics. The notebook for the analysis and model build 
is provided as well as an interactive web application for viewing the data as well as the classification and 
predictive models. There is also functionality for input of user data into the predictive model to return a 
probability score for cardiovascular disease. The web app is available at the url below.

## Screencasts
The screencast file has informative videos about the cardiovascular disease models as well as the overall 
functionality of the web application. All videos are WebM files that can be played by a media player or viewed 
in your web browser.
